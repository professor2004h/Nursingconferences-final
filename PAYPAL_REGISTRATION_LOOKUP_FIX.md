# PayPal Registration Lookup Fix - CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

The automatic email processing was failing because the PayPal capture order endpoint was using the **wrong field** to lookup registration records in Sanity.

## 📊 **Problem Analysis from Logs**

```
✅ Registration payment status updated successfully: kWkIvI7T6XFbABGiWTexhE
🚀 Starting automatic post-payment processing for registration: 0MB44059FR786905M
⚠️ Registration not found, retry 1/3...
⚠️ Registration not found, retry 2/3...
⚠️ Registration not found, retry 3/3...
❌ Registration not found after 3 attempts: 0MB44059FR786905M
```

**Issue:** The code was looking for `_id == "0MB44059FR786905M"` but should have been looking for `registrationId == "0MB44059FR786905M"`

- **Sanity Document ID:** `kWkIvI7T6XFbABGiWTexhE` (internal Sanity document ID)
- **PayPal Order ID:** `0MB44059FR786905M` (stored in `registrationId` field)

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **Before (Incorrect Query):**
```typescript
registration = await client.fetch(
  `*[_type == "conferenceRegistration" && _id == $registrationId][0]{...}`,
  { registrationId }
);
```

### **After (Correct Query):**
```typescript
registration = await client.fetch(
  `*[_type == "conferenceRegistration" && registrationId == $registrationId][0]{...}`,
  { registrationId }
);
```

## 🔍 **Enhanced Debugging Added**

Added comprehensive logging to track registration lookup:

```typescript
console.log(`🔍 Searching for registration with registrationId: ${registrationId}`);

if (registration) {
  console.log('✅ Registration found successfully:', {
    _id: registration._id,
    registrationId: registration.registrationId,
    email: registration.email || registration.personalDetails?.email,
    paypalOrderId: registration.paypalOrderId
  });
} else {
  // Debug: Check if there are any registrations with similar IDs
  const debugResults = await client.fetch(
    `*[_type == "conferenceRegistration" && (registrationId match "*${registrationId.slice(-8)}*" || paypalOrderId == $registrationId)][0...3]{...}`,
    { registrationId }
  );
  console.log('🔍 Debug: Similar registrations found:', debugResults);
}
```

## 🔄 **How Registration ID Mapping Works**

1. **Registration Creation:** User fills form → Temporary ID created (e.g., `TEMP-1234567890`)
2. **PayPal Order Creation:** PayPal Order ID generated (e.g., `0MB44059FR786905M`)
3. **Registration Update:** `registrationId` field updated from temp ID to PayPal Order ID
4. **Payment Capture:** System looks up registration by `registrationId == PayPal Order ID`
5. **Email Processing:** Registration found → PDF generated → Email sent → Sanity storage

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **1. Test the Fix**
Complete a new PayPal payment and monitor console logs for:

```
🔍 Searching for registration with registrationId: [PayPal Order ID]
✅ Registration found successfully: {
  _id: "[Sanity Document ID]",
  registrationId: "[PayPal Order ID]",
  email: "[Customer Email]",
  paypalOrderId: "[PayPal Order ID]"
}
🚀 Calling sendPaymentReceiptEmailWithRealData...
✅ AUTOMATIC post-payment processing completed successfully
```

### **2. Expected Success Flow**
1. Customer completes PayPal payment
2. PayPal capture order API called with PayPal Order ID
3. **Registration found by `registrationId` field** ✅
4. PDF receipt generated automatically
5. Email sent with PDF attachment automatically
6. PDF stored in Sanity automatically
7. Customer receives email within 30 seconds

### **3. Verification Points**
- ✅ Console shows "Registration found successfully"
- ✅ Console shows "AUTOMATIC post-payment processing completed successfully"
- ✅ Customer receives email automatically
- ✅ Email contains PDF receipt attachment
- ✅ PDF appears in Sanity Studio
- ✅ Registration record updated with processing status

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Success Indicators:**
```
💰 PayPal Capture Order API called - Starting payment capture process...
✅ Registration payment status updated successfully: [Sanity Document ID]
🚀 Starting automatic post-payment processing for registration: [PayPal Order ID]
🔍 Searching for registration with registrationId: [PayPal Order ID]
✅ Registration found successfully: {...}
📧 Automatically sending payment receipt to: [Customer Email]
🚀 Calling sendPaymentReceiptEmailWithRealData...
📧 Email processing result: { success: true, pdfGenerated: true, pdfUploaded: true }
✅ AUTOMATIC post-payment processing completed successfully
```

### **If Still Failing:**
- Check if registration was properly updated with PayPal Order ID
- Verify Sanity database has registration with matching `registrationId`
- Check SMTP configuration for email sending issues
- Monitor debug logs for similar registrations

## 🎉 **Result**

The critical registration lookup issue has been fixed. The PayPal capture order endpoint now correctly queries registrations by the `registrationId` field instead of the `_id` field.

**Automatic email processing should now work correctly!** 🚀

The system will now:
1. ✅ Find the registration record correctly
2. ✅ Generate PDF receipt automatically
3. ✅ Send email with PDF attachment automatically
4. ✅ Store PDF in Sanity automatically
5. ✅ Update registration with processing status
