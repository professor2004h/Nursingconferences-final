# Gallery Toggle Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to show or hide the **Gallery** option in the "More" dropdown menu of the website navigation using the Sanity CMS.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Gallery Settings Schema**
- Created a new `gallerySettings` schema in Sanity CMS
- Singleton document (only one settings document exists)
- Located at: `SanityBackend/schemaTypes/gallerySettings.ts`

### 2. **Toggle Controls**
The Gallery Settings document includes the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Show Gallery in Navigation** | Boolean | Toggle to show/hide the Gallery link in the More dropdown menu | `true` |
| **Navigation Label** | String | Customize the text displayed for the Gallery link | `"Gallery"` |
| **Show on Homepage** | Boolean | Toggle to show/hide Gallery section on homepage (future feature) | `false` |

### 3. **API Endpoint**
- Created `/api/gallery-settings` endpoint
- Returns gallery settings with caching (30 seconds)
- Provides default values if settings not found

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
- Updated `HeaderClient.tsx` to fetch and use gallery settings
- Gallery link conditionally rendered based on `showGallery` setting
- Works in both desktop dropdown and mobile menu
- Custom navigation label support

## üîß Technical Details

### **Files Modified/Created:**

1. **Backend (Sanity):**
   - `SanityBackend/schemaTypes/gallerySettings.ts` - New schema
   - `SanityBackend/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Added gallerySettings to exports
   - `SanityBackend/create-gallery-settings.js` - Initialization script

2. **Frontend (Next.js):**
   - `nextjs-frontend/src/app/api/gallery-settings/route.ts` - New API endpoint
   - `nextjs-frontend/src/app/components/HeaderClient.tsx` - Updated to use settings

### **How It Works:**

1. **Settings Storage:**
   - Gallery settings are stored in Sanity CMS as a singleton document
   - Only one settings document can exist (enforced by `__experimental_singleton`)

2. **Data Flow:**
   ```
   Sanity CMS (gallerySettings)
        ‚Üì
   API Endpoint (/api/gallery-settings)
        ‚Üì
   HeaderClient Component (useEffect fetch)
        ‚Üì
   Conditional Rendering (showGallery check)
        ‚Üì
   Gallery Link Visible/Hidden
   ```

3. **Caching:**
   - API responses are cached for 30 seconds
   - Changes may take up to 30 seconds to appear on the website
   - Force refresh the page to see changes immediately

4. **Default Behavior:**
   - If settings document doesn't exist: Gallery is **shown** by default
   - If API fails: Gallery is **shown** by default (fail-safe)
   - Navigation label defaults to "Gallery" if not specified

## üé® Customization Examples

### **Example 1: Hide Gallery Completely**
```
Show Gallery in Navigation: OFF
Navigation Label: Gallery
```
**Result:** Gallery link is hidden from all navigation menus

### **Example 2: Show with Custom Label**
```
Show Gallery in Navigation: ON
Navigation Label: Photo Gallery
```
**Result:** Link appears as "Photo Gallery" in navigation

### **Example 3: Conference-Specific Label**
```
Show Gallery in Navigation: ON
Navigation Label: ICMCNM 2024 Photos
```
**Result:** Link appears as "ICMCNM 2024 Photos" in navigation

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Gallery link not appearing after enabling:**
1. Wait 30 seconds for cache to refresh
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify the setting is published (not just saved as draft)

### **Changes not reflecting:**
1. Ensure you clicked **"Publish"** (not just save)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if both frontend and backend servers are running
4. Verify API endpoint is accessible: `http://localhost:3000/api/gallery-settings`

### **Gallery link still showing after disabling:**
1. Verify the toggle is OFF and published
2. Wait for cache to expire (30 seconds)
3. Check browser console for cached responses
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode
