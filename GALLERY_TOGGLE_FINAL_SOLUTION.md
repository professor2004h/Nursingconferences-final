## 📍 Where to Find the Toggle

### **Sanity Studio Path:**
1. http://localhost:3333
2. Click **"Conference Gallery"** in the sidebar
3. Click on any gallery item
4. Find **"Active Gallery"** toggle

## 🎨 What the Toggle Controls

The **"Active Gallery"** toggle on each gallery item controls **TWO things**:

1. **Gallery Page Display:**
   - ON = Gallery appears on `/past-conference-gallery` page
   - OFF = Gallery is hidden from the gallery page

2. **Navigation Link Visibility:**
   - If ANY gallery is ON = Gallery link appears in navigation
   - If ALL galleries are OFF = Gallery link is hidden from navigation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **API Endpoint:**
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/gallery-settings
```

### **Response When Galleries Are Active:**
```json
{
  "showGallery": true,
  "navigationLabel": "Gallery",
  "showOnHomepage": false,
  "activeGalleryCount": 1
}
```

### **Response When No Galleries Are Active:**
```json
{
  "showGallery": false,
  "navigationLabel": "Gallery",
  "showOnHomepage": false,
  "activeGalleryCount": 0
}
```

### **Logic:**
```javascript
// Count active galleries
const activeGalleryCount = count(*[_type == "pastConferenceGallery" && isActive == true])

// Show gallery link if there are any active galleries
const showGallery = activeGalleryCount > 0
```

### **No Caching:**
- Changes appear immediately (no cache delay)
- Simply refresh your browser to see changes

## ✅ Testing

### **Test 1: Hide Gallery Link**
1. Turn OFF "Active Gallery" on all gallery items
2. Publish each gallery
3. Run: `node verify-gallery-toggle.js`
4. Expected: `Active galleries: 0` → Gallery link HIDDEN
5. Refresh website and check More dropdown

### **Test 2: Show Gallery Link**
1. Turn ON "Active Gallery" on at least one gallery item
2. Publish the gallery
3. Run: `node verify-gallery-toggle.js`
4. Expected: `Active galleries: 1+` → Gallery link VISIBLE
5. Refresh website and check More dropdown

### **Test 3: API Response**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gallery-settings
```
Check that `showGallery` matches the active gallery count
