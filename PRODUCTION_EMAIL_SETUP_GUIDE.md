# PRODUCTION EMAIL SETUP GUIDE - AUTOMATIC EMAILS AFTER PAYPAL PAYMENTS

## üö® **ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Missing Environment Variables**

The diagnostic has identified that automatic emails are not working because of missing environment variables in your Coolify production deployment.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### **‚úÖ Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variables in Coolify**

**Access your Coolify dashboard and add these environment variables:**

```bash
# SMTP Configuration (Already configured)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
SMTP_PASS=Muni@12345m

# MISSING: Email Configuration (ADD THESE)
EMAIL_FROM=contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Intelli Global Conferences

# MISSING: PayPal Webhook Configuration (ADD THESE)
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your_webhook_id_from_paypal_dashboard

# Sanity Configuration (Already configured)
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_write_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=zt8218vh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-05-03

# PayPal Configuration (Already configured)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_paypal_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_paypal_client_secret
```

### **‚úÖ Step 2: Configure PayPal Webhook in PayPal Dashboard**

**1. Access PayPal Developer Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/
- Login with your PayPal business account
- Navigate to "My Apps & Credentials"

**2. Create/Configure Webhook:**
- Click "Create App" or select existing app
- Go to "Webhooks" section
- Click "Add Webhook"

**3. Webhook Configuration:**
```
Webhook URL: https://yourdomain.com/api/paypal/webhook
Events to subscribe to:
- ‚úÖ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED
- ‚úÖ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.PENDING
- ‚úÖ CHECKOUT.ORDER.COMPLETED
```

**4. Get Webhook ID:**
- After creating webhook, copy the "Webhook ID"
- Add it to Coolify as `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` environment variable

### **‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Webhook URL Accessibility**

**Test your webhook URL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/paypal/webhook
```

**Expected Response:**
- Status: 400 (Bad Request) - This is correct
- Should NOT return 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Server Error)

## üîç **ENHANCED WEBHOOK SYSTEM**

### **‚úÖ New Features Added**

**1. Enhanced Logging:**
- Detailed environment configuration logging
- Comprehensive error tracking
