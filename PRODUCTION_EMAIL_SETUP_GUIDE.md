# PRODUCTION EMAIL SETUP GUIDE - AUTOMATIC EMAILS AFTER PAYPAL PAYMENTS

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Missing Environment Variables**

The diagnostic has identified that automatic emails are not working because of missing environment variables in your Coolify production deployment.

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### **✅ Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variables in Coolify**

**Access your Coolify dashboard and add these environment variables:**

```bash
# SMTP Configuration (Already configured)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
SMTP_PASS=Muni@12345m

# MISSING: Email Configuration (ADD THESE)
EMAIL_FROM=contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Intelli Global Conferences

# MISSING: PayPal Webhook Configuration (ADD THESE)
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your_webhook_id_from_paypal_dashboard

# Sanity Configuration (Already configured)
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_write_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=zt8218vh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-05-03

# PayPal Configuration (Already configured)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_paypal_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_paypal_client_secret
```

### **✅ Step 2: Configure PayPal Webhook in PayPal Dashboard**

**1. Access PayPal Developer Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/
- Login with your PayPal business account
- Navigate to "My Apps & Credentials"

**2. Create/Configure Webhook:**
- Click "Create App" or select existing app
- Go to "Webhooks" section
- Click "Add Webhook"

**3. Webhook Configuration:**
```
Webhook URL: https://yourdomain.com/api/paypal/webhook
Events to subscribe to:
- ✅ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
- ✅ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED
- ✅ PAYMENT.CAPTURE.PENDING
- ✅ CHECKOUT.ORDER.COMPLETED
```

**4. Get Webhook ID:**
- After creating webhook, copy the "Webhook ID"
- Add it to Coolify as `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` environment variable

### **✅ Step 3: Verify Webhook URL Accessibility**

**Test your webhook URL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/paypal/webhook
```

**Expected Response:**
- Status: 400 (Bad Request) - This is correct
- Should NOT return 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Server Error)

## 🔍 **ENHANCED WEBHOOK SYSTEM**

### **✅ New Features Added**

**1. Enhanced Logging:**
- Detailed environment configuration logging
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Production debugging information

**2. Better Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of missing environment variables
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Automatic registration updates with failure status

**3. Configuration Validation:**
- Real-time environment variable checking
- SMTP configuration validation
- PayPal webhook verification

### **✅ Webhook Processing Flow**

```
PayPal Payment → Webhook Triggered → Environment Check → Email Sent → PDF Stored
```

**Enhanced Flow:**
1. **Webhook Received**: PayPal sends PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
2. **Environment Check**: Validates all required environment variables
3. **Registration Fetch**: Retrieves customer data from Sanity
4. **Email Generation**: Creates professional PDF receipt
5. **Email Delivery**: Sends to customer's email address
6. **PDF Storage**: Uploads PDF to Sanity backend
7. **Status Update**: Updates registration with delivery status
