# Gallery Toggle - Updated Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Updated

The Gallery navigation link now automatically shows/hides based on whether there are **active galleries**.

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Automatic Logic:**
- ✅ **If ANY gallery has "Active Gallery" = ON** → Gallery link appears in navigation
- ❌ **If ALL galleries have "Active Gallery" = OFF** → Gallery link is hidden from navigation

### **No Separate Settings Needed:**
- You don't need to go to a separate "Gallery Settings" page
- Simply toggle the "Active Gallery" on individual gallery items
- The navigation link automatically updates based on active galleries

---

## 📋 How to Hide/Show the Gallery Link

### **To HIDE the Gallery Link:**
1. Go to each gallery item in Sanity Studio
2. Turn OFF the "Active Gallery" toggle on ALL galleries

### **To SHOW the Gallery Link:**
1. Go to at least ONE gallery item in Sanity Studio

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **API Endpoint:**
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/gallery-settings
```

### **Response Format:**
```json
{
  "showGallery": false,
  "navigationLabel": "Gallery",
  "showOnHomepage": false,
  "activeGalleryCount": 0
}
```

### **Logic:**
```javascript
// Show gallery link if there are any active galleries
const activeGalleryCount = count(*[_type == "pastConferenceGallery" && isActive == true])
const showGallery = activeGalleryCount > 0
```

### **Caching:**
- API responses cached for 30 seconds
- Changes may take up to 30 seconds to appear
- Hard refresh browser to see changes immediately

## 📊 Files Modified

### **Updated:**
- `nextjs-frontend/src/app/api/gallery-settings/route.ts` - Changed to check active galleries

### **No Longer Needed:**
- `gallerySettings` schema (can be removed if desired)
- `SanityBackend/schemaTypes/gallerySettings.ts`
- `toggle-gallery-visibility.js` script

### **Still Valid:**
- `HeaderClient.tsx` - Still uses the API endpoint

- Active galleries: 0
- Gallery link: HIDDEN

### **Test 2: At Least One Gallery Active**
1. Turn ON "Active Gallery" on any gallery item
2. Publish the change
3. Run: `node check-gallery-items.js`
**Expected:**

- Gallery link: VISIBLE

### **Test 3: API Response**

## 🎯 Current Behavior

### **Right Now:**
- ✅ API updated to check active galleries
- ✅ All galleries are currently inactive (isActive: false)
- ✅ API returns `showGallery: false`
- ⏳ Frontend cache may take 30 seconds to update
- ⏳ Gallery link should disappear after cache refresh

### **To See Changes Immediately:**
1. Hard refresh your browser: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Or wait 30 seconds for cache to expire
3. Gallery link should be gone from the More dropdown

## 💡 Advantages of This Approach

4. **Consistent:** Same toggle controls both gallery page display AND navigation link
5. **Efficient:** One toggle controls everything
